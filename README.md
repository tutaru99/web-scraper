scraping the world

@TODO
- Deeper level scraping (article->link->article content)
- Scraping results are stored in the database
- Duplicate detection / Scraping per item performed only once
- Implement rate limiting when needed
- Look into captcha and how cheerio can handle it
- Automatic periodic check for new results(?)
- Alternative scraping option with pupeteer when chosen for dynamic websites (?)
